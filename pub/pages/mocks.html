            <li>This page is used for demonstartion of my library at this time. My JS library is called GammaJS which is intended for better DOM representation of datas related to entertainment and media such as music, movie, game and book. </li>
            <li>I have created multiple templates for representing datas of musics, movies, games and books which would be demonstrated below.</li> 
            <!-- together with my envisioned use of them in a real-life website. -->
            <li>Those each indivitual data representation(will be refered as cards) also comes with extra features. By hovering on some cards, you could get more detailed information about the item you are hovering on a popup window  without the need to actually click into the page of the item. This feature could be turned off when the cards are first created by the developer.</li>
            <li>Another feature for those cards is that the by dragging the card or its popup window onto another card of the same category, there would be a popup window of a comparison of the two items.</li>
            <li>Right now all the data are hardcoded and the link to the detailed page for specific items, which would be passed in by the developer, are not available. </li>
